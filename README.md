HTC-One-X-CSS3
==============

HTC-One-X-CSS3 is my weekend project. I've tried to draw the amazing HTC One X phone purely in CSS3. The only two images are the gif animation as the display and noise image for subtle noise on the device body.

Bugs
-----------

I only tested this in Firefox 16b and Chrome 23dev. I found that the speaker class is not well rendered in Chrome, so if you find the solution for it, you can commit changes.

If you've found a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub:
