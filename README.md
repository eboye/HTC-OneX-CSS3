HTC-One-X-CSS3
==============

HTC-One-X-CSS3 is my weekend project. I've tried to draw the amazing HTC One X phone purely in CSS3. The only two images are the gif animation as the display and noise image for subtle noise on the device body.

Everything is defined in ems as values. So it is scalable. Also the logo and icons are made as vectors in custom font, so it's clear even on high ppi displays and if scaled up or down.

Bugs
-----------

I only tested this in Firefox 16b and Chrome 23dev. I found that the speaker class is not well rendered in Chrome, so if you find the solution for it, you can commit changes.

If you've found a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub:
